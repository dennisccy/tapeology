# Goal Session yahoo_fetch — Evaluator Log

Chronological record of goal-evaluator verdicts. Append-only.

## Iteration 0 — goal-yahoo_fetch-iter-0

**Date:** 2026-07-08T23:55:00Z
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean (verify-only baseline)
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: none
- Baseline already_passing: J-06 (foundation sentinel)
- Baseline failing (capability absent — honest starting line): J-01, J-02, J-03, J-04, J-05
- Newly failing: none (no prior passing state — first iteration)
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (scan-report CLEAN; `git diff apps/` empty — zero source change)

**Reasoning:** Verify-only baseline executed exactly per spec — developer made zero source
changes (`git diff --stat HEAD -- apps/` empty, independently confirmed; reviewer PASS). I
personally verified the absence of every Era-5 capability: no `yahoo.py` adapter, no `yfinance`
pin or allowlist entry, zero `yahoo`/`yfinance`/`resample` matches in the backend, no
`bar_index.py`, no `"yahoo"` in `FEED_BASIS_LABELS`, no Yahoo fetch control in
`structure/page.tsx`. So J-01/J-02/J-03/J-05 are `failing` (unimplemented) and J-04 `failing`
as a consequence (levels endpoint returns `no_bar_series_for_symbol:true` on the empty store).
J-06 is `already_passing`: full suite 1146 passed / 1 skipped (live-integration opt-in gate),
equivalence 22/22, `config_fingerprint` 4d665603569b9dbf (reviewer independently recomputed),
and an empty `apps/` diff makes foundation regression impossible. This exactly matches the
spec's predicted baseline read.

**Evidence gap (noted, not verdict-changing):** the browser-qa lane did NOT run
(`status.json browser_checks_run:false`; `reports/phase-...-ui-test-results.md` absent; evidence
dir empty) and no `coherence.md` was produced, despite the spec's TESTING REQUIREMENTS asking
for browser checks on J-05/J-06. All six statuses are grounded in code/test evidence I verified
myself, so the gap does not move any status — but iteration 1+ MUST run the browser lane, since
J-05 becomes genuinely browser-verifiable once the fetch control exists, and J-06's surface
checks need a real render once code starts changing.

**Next-step recommendation:** Iteration 1 targets **J-01 alone** — the keyless Yahoo adapter
(`providers/adapters/yahoo.py`, `name="yahoo"`, `fetch_bars` interval mapping), the bar-vendor
selector (Alpaca stays opt-in), the `feed="yahoo"` stamp sourced from the adapter, the pinned
`yfinance` dependency + `install-security-policy.json` allowlist entry, plus its `FakeAdapter`
route test and committed fixture. This is a risky provider integration (new runtime dependency +
vendor selector) that unblocks J-02–J-05 — run it **full** depth and confirm the browser lane
emits evidence.

## Iteration 1 — goal-yahoo_fetch-iter-1

**Date:** 2026-07-09T03:30:00Z
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** full
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: J-01 (keyless Yahoo daily adapter + bar-fetch vendor default)
- Newly failing: none
- Regressed: none (J-06 foundation re-verified green)
- Anti-goal violations: none (scan-report = 1 WARN only: the sanctioned `yfinance` dependency — pinned `yfinance==1.5.1`, confined-to-adapter comment, allowlisted, install gate ALLOW)

**Reasoning:** J-01 verified passing with convergent primary evidence, not just the dev handoff: I
read `yahoo.py` myself (`name="yahoo"`, keyless `is_available()`, `_INTERVAL_MAP={"1d":"1d"}`,
empty-tuple on unmapped-tf / unknown-symbol / empty-window → `EmptyBarWindowError` 422 — no
synthesis/forward-fill/padding, satisfying "No fabricated bars, ever"), confirmed the live keyless
integration fetch PASSED, and saw the real-endpoint path end-to-end in browser UT-14/UT-13 (`POST
/research/bars` for AAPL → HTTP 200, `feed="yahoo"`, `bar_count=24`, real bars) rendered on
`/structure` (UT-07 screenshot: realistic $270–320 AAPL candles + real S/R lines + 28 Class-C
zones — not fabricated round numbers). The crux anti-goal ("Yahoo default must not break the Alpaca
path") is cleanly met: I independently ran `git diff 7ebb15b8..HEAD` over `main.py`/`alpaca.py`/
`config.py`/`levels.py`/`bars.py` = EMPTY (byte-identical); the new default is confined to
`get_bar_fetch_adapter()` on `POST /research/bars` only; `get_adapter()` (cockpit/tick/live/search)
untouched, proven unbroken by UT-01/UT-06 (feed badge "Simulated"). Coherence PASS (single `feed`
owner = adapter), review PASS, QA PASS, audit PASS_WITH_GAPS (B1 = no production Alpaca opt-in on the
bar-fetch endpoint — documented, regresses nothing, out of scope). `config_fingerprint`
`4d665603569b9dbf` and equivalence 22/22 hold, so J-06 stays green. J-02–J-05 remain `failing`
(out of scope this iteration, not attempted-and-failed) → not GOAL_ACHIEVED; progress made → CONTINUE.

**Next-step recommendation:** Iteration 2 targets **J-02** — the full timeframe set (`1w/1d/4h/1h/5m/1m`)
with the deterministic `4h` resample-from-`1h` (open=first/high=max/low=min/close=last/volume=sum,
session-aligned, honest partial trailing bucket) and the out-of-retention / unsupported-timeframe
honest-neutral-error taxonomy. Recommend **full** depth: the `4h` resampler is the era's single named
new backend computation and carries its own critical anti-goal ("`4h` is honestly derived") plus the
"no fabricated bars" rail, so the audit + coherence lanes must run (coherence should confirm the
derived-`4h` value stays single-owner and honestly labelled). Carry the fixture-location lesson (a
`feed="yahoo"` fixture cannot live under `tests/fixtures/bars/` — a frozen test blanket-asserts
`feed=="sip"` over that whole dir) into J-02's committed 1h/4h fixtures.

> **[Operational note — re-dispatch, NOT a new verdict] 2026-07-09.** The iteration-1
> evaluator was re-dispatched (known goal-evaluator inflight-timeout requeue). The original
> instance had already completed its evidence walk and written every state artifact
> (this log's iter-1 entry above, `journey-history.json`, `lessons.md`, `assumptions.md` — all
> 10:21-10:22) but was interrupted before writing `iter-1/eval.md` (step 6, the final artifact).
> Confirmed by: `iter-1/journey-history.pre.json` (dispatch snapshot) is byte-identical to the
> already-updated `journey-history.json` (both show J-01 `passing`, `last_passing=iter-1`);
> `coherence.md` was NOT regenerated on re-dispatch (dated 03:59 = original pipeline output);
> `snapshot-sha` 7ebb15b8 and HEAD unmoved; no new dev work. The re-dispatched instance
> re-verified the recorded **CONTINUE** verdict against the deterministic gates (scan 0-critical,
> coherence PASS, review/QA PASS, audit PASS_WITH_GAPS) and J-01's UT-07 evidence screenshot,
> then wrote the missing `eval.md` and re-affirmed `journey-history.json` (identical content).
> No status changed; the iter-1 verdict above stands as the single authoritative record — this
> note is not a second evaluation.
