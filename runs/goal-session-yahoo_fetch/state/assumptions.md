# Goal Session yahoo_fetch — Assumption Ledger

Append-only. Agents log interpretation calls here (a goal/journey ambiguity + the
reading chosen) so the product owner can veto a wrong reading early. Signal only —
routine evidence reading is not an assumption.

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** The spec's TESTING REQUIREMENTS named browser checks for J-05 (locate the
`/structure` fetch control) and J-06 (spot-check existing surfaces), but the lean baseline
pipeline never ran the browser-qa lane (no screenshots, no `ui-test-results.md`). The spec
does not say whether an absent-capability journey may be scored without the browser leg it names.
**We chose:** Score J-05 `failing` and J-06 `already_passing` on code/test evidence instead —
J-05's fetch control and `"yahoo"` taxonomy label are provably absent by source inspection, and
J-06 rests on the green suite (1146 passed) + `config_fingerprint` match + an empty `apps/` diff
(regression is impossible with zero source change). A browser screenshot would only re-show the
same absence / unchanged surfaces.
**Reversible:** yes
