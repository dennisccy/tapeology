# Goal Session yahoo_fetch — Assumption Ledger

Append-only. Agents log interpretation calls here (a goal/journey ambiguity + the
reading chosen) so the product owner can veto a wrong reading early. Signal only —
routine evidence reading is not an assumption.

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** The spec's TESTING REQUIREMENTS named browser checks for J-05 (locate the
`/structure` fetch control) and J-06 (spot-check existing surfaces), but the lean baseline
pipeline never ran the browser-qa lane (no screenshots, no `ui-test-results.md`). The spec
does not say whether an absent-capability journey may be scored without the browser leg it names.
**We chose:** Score J-05 `failing` and J-06 `already_passing` on code/test evidence instead —
J-05's fetch control and `"yahoo"` taxonomy label are provably absent by source inspection, and
J-06 rests on the green suite (1146 passed) + `config_fingerprint` match + an empty `apps/` diff
(regression is impossible with zero source change). A browser screenshot would only re-show the
same absence / unchanged surfaces.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-1 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** J-01's acceptance requires "`GET /research/bars/{id}` AND the MCP `bars` proxy return it byte-for-byte." The REST half was proven directly (new `test_bars_api.py` byte-for-byte `GET .../{id}`), but no Yahoo-SPECIFIC MCP `bars` test was added — the goal text does not say whether a per-feed MCP proof is required or whether the generic proxy guarantee suffices.
**We chose:** Scored J-01 `passing` accepting the MCP half on the architectural byte-identity argument (audit T1): `app/mcp/__init__.py` maps `"bars" -> "/research/bars"` and passes `response.text` verbatim with ZERO `feed`-awareness anywhere in the MCP layer, and the existing unmodified `test_mcp_server.py::test_bars_tool_byte_identical_on_a_non_empty_live_list` (real uvicorn subprocess) already proves the proxy generically — a Yahoo-stamped series traverses it identically to any other, so a Yahoo-specific duplicate would be redundant coverage, not new defense.
**Reversible:** yes
