# Goal Session desk — Evaluator Log

Append-only chronological record. One entry per evaluated iteration.

## Iteration 0 — goal-desk-iter-0

**Date:** 2026-07-25T03:25:01+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: none
- Newly failing: J-01, J-02, J-03, J-04, J-05, J-06 (baseline recording of a not-yet-started era — expected, not a defect)
- Partial: J-07 (kept-product half fully evidenced; its own "nav = 3 routes" / "MCP = 17 tools" clauses unmet at 2/15 until J-04/J-06 ship)
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (scan-report CLEAN; `git diff --stat 047c38e -- apps/` empty; pin `08e471b10130e1e2` re-verified live)

**Reasoning:** Verify-only baseline with genuinely zero source diff — I re-ran every absence claim
myself (desk route greps, `UI_ROUTES` = 2, `EXPECTED_TOOLS` = 15, no `desk_universe_*` Config field,
no `.data/universe/`, no `useSearchParams` in `structure/page.tsx`) rather than trusting the
handoff, and opened all five load-bearing screenshots. J-07's kept-product evidence is strong
(suite 1169p/7s matching the era-open baseline, sim cockpit settling Buyer Control with live tape
bars + timeframe switch, real SIP AAPL 1d candles with the 302.20/300.10 band overlay, `/structure`
resistance 300.11–302.2 Class A, Case Study drill-in, honest Edge Report panel) — but two clauses
of its literal acceptance are structurally unmet today, so `partial` is the honest score, not
`already_passing`. CONTINUE because failing journeys remain and every one is tractable and
un-blocked. Coherence audit is absent (no coherence step ran this lean baseline) — noted, not a
veto driver here since GOAL_ACHIEVED was structurally impossible.

**Next-step recommendation:** Target **J-01 alone** (universe vendor seam + parser contract +
frozen-JSON store + committed fixture + `POST /research/desk/universe/fetch` / `GET
/research/desk/universe`) — first in the stated dependency order and the hard unblocker for
J-02–J-06. **Run iteration 1 at `full` depth**: new store format with append-only semantics (T-3),
the era's first Path-A Config fields needing exclusion + stability + counter-test + payload
provenance in one commit (T-5), and a parser that must fail loudly instead of emitting a partial
list (T-1/T-2) — too much unverifiable-by-assertion surface for a lean pass. Also: re-point
`journey-scripts/J-07.json` step 8 off the async `300.11` text onto a static shell string before
the replay lane runs it, and warm the scoped QA backend's setups cache (measured ~9–11 min cold vs
0.84 s warm) before browser QA.

## Iteration 1 — goal-desk-iter-1

**Date:** 2026-07-25T06:05:00+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** full
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: J-01
- Newly failing: none
- Partial: J-07 (backend/keyless subset re-verified — suite 1210p/8s/0f, pin unchanged, 14/14 kept
  routes byte-identical; its "3 nav routes"/"17 MCP tools" clauses still unmet at 2/15)
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (scan-report CLEAN; all 20 rails checked individually — two documented
  gaps, both minor and non-violating: audit B3's silent corrupt-file self-heal and B1's
  latency-only cache invalidation)

**Reasoning:** I did not take the handoffs' word for J-01: I re-ran all four acceptance clauses
myself in-process against the REAL route handlers with the universe dir scoped to a temp dir and
fixture HTML injected into the vendor seam (empty GET 200 honest payload; fixture POST 200 with
12-char checksum `817cc184bbb3`, 103 members, sorted/unique/normalized, `raw_members["BRK-B"]=="BRK.B"`,
provenance embedded; corrupted POST 422 naming ticker `AVG1` with zero files registered; duplicate
POST 409 with the file's sha256 byte-unchanged), re-ran the full suite (1210 passed / 8 skipped / 0
failed), re-printed the pin (`08e471b10130e1e2`, still unchanged under a `desk_universe_min_members=500`
override — Path A genuinely holds), and diffed the TC-11 capture myself (14/14 rows byte-identical).
Browser QA was SKIPPED and no screenshot exists, but J-01's goal.md acceptance carries no browser
clause ("Keyless; automated"), so live REST through the real handlers is the honest equivalent — logged
in assumptions.md. COHERENCE-PASS, so no structural veto; CONTINUE because five journeys remain and
every one is tractable and keyless.

**Next-step recommendation:** Target **J-02 alone** (coverage from `bar_index` + explicit resumable
top-up) at **`full` depth** — first desk compute manager (single-flight/progress/cancel), the
store-first all-reused claim, an index-read latency claim, and the timeframe-set contract against
frozen `levels.py`/`compute_tradability`. Spec MUST carry: (1) `edge_report_cache._config_content_hash`
is a SECOND whole-config hash with no exclusion set — this diff changed it to `dc0271c15a26…`,
stranding the setups/tradability/edge-report/backtest cache rows, so `/research/setups` is cold
(~9–11 min) and `/structure` Load ~21.6 s until re-warmed; decide the policy and warm before J-04's
browser pass; (2) `.data/universe/` is pre-populated with the live snapshot
`universe-2026-07-25-49b33fa31680.json`, so an identical live POST now 409s; (3) hardening — parser
`skipped_rows` count, make B3's corrupt-file replacement loud, skip floor = 8 non-decreasing, widen
TC-11 to all 24 kept GET templates against a populated data dir; (4) still pending from iter-0 —
re-point `journey-scripts/J-07.json` step 8 off the async `300.11` text and warm the scoped QA
setups cache before any browser pass.
