# Goal Session tape_to_profit — Evaluator Log

## Iteration 0 — goal-tape_to_profit-iter-0

**Date:** 2026-07-03T02:25:50+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: none (baseline — J-08 recorded `already_passing`)
- Newly failing: J-01, J-02, J-03, J-04, J-05, J-06, J-07 (baseline absence — not built, exactly as the spec predicted)
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (zero source changes; `git diff HEAD` empty)

**Reasoning:** Verify-only baseline executed cleanly. J-08 verified passing with independent evidence at every layer: 848/849 backend suite green, equivalence suite 7/7, and browser screenshots confirming SIM-BUYER → Buyer Control and SIM-SELLER → Seller Control with all cockpit panels populated plus honest empty states on /journal and /studies. All seven era-3 journeys confirmed absent via live 404s / module-not-found probes plus screenshots — matching the spec's prediction letter for letter. Coherence audit not run (zero-diff baseline, blueprint drafted this iteration) — no veto. Era-3 baseline anchor: 848 passing tests, 3-entry nav.

**Next-step recommendation:** Iter-1 = J-01 (MCP server + `/meta/ui-routes` + nav rendered from the route map) at lean depth — independent of the J-02→J-05 chain, unlocks MCP-assisted verification for all later work, and retires the hardcoded NavBar list before J-05 adds a Performance entry (pre-empting a duplicate nav source-of-truth coherence risk). J-02 is the acceptable alternate. J-08 goes into required-still-passing from iter-1 onward.

## Iteration 1 — goal-tape_to_profit-iter-1

**Date:** 2026-07-03T04:14:31+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: J-01
- Newly failing: none
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (MCP verified GET-only with zero `app`-package imports; policy diff exactly one allowlist entry `mcp`; `.mcp.json` untracked; equivalence 7/7 re-run independently by this evaluator)

**Reasoning:** J-01 passes on cross-checked evidence at every layer: reviewer independently re-ran the 20 new tests plus the full suite (868 passed / 1 skipped, exact match to the dev handoff), browser QA produced four screenshots (all inspected — nav renders exactly Cockpit/Journal/Studies from `GET /meta/ui-routes` on all pages, `/journal/[id]` keeps Journal active, no Performance, no degraded state), the dev's live stdio session proved byte-identity and backend-down honesty, and I re-executed `test_meta_routes.py` + equivalence (12/12, exit 0). J-08 stays green (suite + equivalence twice-run, all three surfaces screenshot-verified) with one caveat: the deterministic J-08 replay silently no-oped — Playwright is not installed (engine.log 04:00:13) — so the SIM-BUYER in-browser leg rests on the live API verification plus untouched cockpit code this iteration. Coherence: COHERENCE-PASS.

**Next-step recommendation:** Iter-2 = J-02 (dataset store: record/register, checksum verification, immutable train/hold-out tags with 409 re-tag refusal, committed fixture pair, byte-identical replay) at lean depth — head of the J-02→J-05 chain; the MCP `datasets` tool flips from honest 404 to live data with zero MCP changes. Must-fix alongside: install Playwright for the replay runner (or have browser QA run the J-08 SIM-BUYER leg explicitly) so required-still-passing browser regression checks stop silently no-oping.

## Iteration 2 — goal-tape_to_profit-iter-2

**Date:** 2026-07-03T06:00:19+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: J-02
- Newly failing: none
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (no execution/broker code — import + grep verified; MCP untouched, `git diff -- app/mcp app/meta.py` empty; policy diff exactly one `"playwright"` allowlist entry, spec-authorized; runtime datasets gitignored; no ambient recording browser-proven via real cockpit watch/stop with md5sum-identical dataset dir)

**Reasoning:** J-02 passes on evidence this evaluator re-verified independently at every layer: full suite re-run 901 passed / 1 skipped (exact match to dev + reviewer; 902 collected = iter-1's 869 + 33 new, nothing deleted), the 32 new dataset tests + 16 MCP tests + equivalence 7/7 all re-run green, and all key screenshots inspected — the 404→200 flip against the iter-0 baseline, full metadata (symbol/UTC window/feed/counts/checksum/frozen split), the 409 frozen-tag refusal, a tampered file surfacing explicitly in `integrity_errors` while healthy rows kept serving, and restore-to-clean. The iter-1 must-fix landed: Playwright 1.61.0 installed and the deterministic replay lane produced real rows (engine.log 05:25:42, demo_runner verdict PASS 2/2) — J-01-verify.png and J-08-verify.png match their golden scripts' final steps exactly, closing the silent no-op hole. Coherence: COHERENCE-PASS (single writer, one verified load path, exactly three routes, MCP flip free by construction).

**Next-step recommendation:** Iter-3 = J-03 (strategy grammar v1 + deterministic backtest engine: config-owned entries/exits, fee/slippage models, $-per-R notional, `POST/GET /research/backtests` + cancel as a studies-style job, per-trade report with net/gross R AND $ beside a seeded random-entry null baseline, full provenance, byte-identical re-runs) at lean depth — next link in the J-02→J-05 chain, keyless on the committed fixture pair via `DatasetStore.replay`. MCP `backtests` flips from honest 404 with zero MCP code changes; when moving it out of the test suite's honest-404 premise, fold in the reviewer's NOTE (stale "404 until J-02 ships" description at app/mcp/__init__.py:165). J-03's acceptance also demands the grep-style no-broker/order/account test — build it in from the start.

## Iteration 3 — goal-tape_to_profit-iter-3

**Date:** 2026-07-03T08:34:58+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: J-03
- Newly failing: none
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (no-execution gate 4/4 re-run by this evaluator and proven signal-bearing; MCP diff read directly — exactly two description strings; engine/serializers/datasets/meta/requirements zero diff; equivalence 7/7 re-run; register string verbatim in evidence; goal.md untouched)

**Reasoning:** J-03 passes on independently cross-checked evidence: full suite re-run green by this evaluator (952 collected — 951 passed / 1 skipped, exact match to dev + reviewer; +50 tests over iter-2, none deleted), the 42 new backtest/API/no-broker tests green, and all three J-03 screenshots inspected — the 404→200 flip, a done report carrying per-trade fills/fees/slippage, aggregates (net/gross R AND $, win rate 0.2, max drawdown, n=5), seeded null baseline (seed 1729, entry_count 100), full verbatim provenance, and the exact register string, plus honest 404/422 error legs. Byte-identity verified three ways (QA's two independent POSTs → identical 59,157-char result blocks; dev's live 59,844-byte re-POST; the API-level test). J-01/J-02/J-08 all re-verified with explicit result rows (replay lane crashed, browser-qa ran the fallback legs per the iter-1 lesson). Coherence: COHERENCE-PASS. Root cause found for this iteration's browser instability: the per-user tmpfs quota on /tmp (5.2G) is pinned by ~4.5G of accumulated pytest basetemp dirs — it killed Playwright at launch, starved Chrome, and initially broke this evaluator's own suite run; deletion was permission-denied, so it remains outstanding.

**Next-step recommendation:** Iter-4 = J-04 (append-only PnL ledger: founding baseline row from strategy v1 on the fixture train AND hold-out datasets via this iteration's backtest reports; `GET /research/pnl/ledger`; pure-rendered `reports/pnl/pnl-history.md` with byte-level no-op regeneration; no update/delete paths; "insufficient sample" labeling; MCP `pnl_ledger` out of NOT_YET_SHIPPED with the non-empty-200 byte-identity test) at lean depth. Environment must-fix: clear `/tmp/pytest-of-dennis-chan` (~4.5G, pins the per-user tmpfs quota) or route pytest basetemp off tmpfs — otherwise browser lanes and large suite runs stay flaky.

## Iteration 4 — goal-tape_to_profit-iter-4

**Date:** 2026-07-03T10:17:12+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: J-04
- Newly failing: none
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none

**Reasoning:** J-04 verified passing on multi-surface evidence: iter-0 404 → live 200 with the founding row (explicit `baseline: null`, candidate net R+$ per split, n=1 both splits labeled insufficient sample, full provenance, register verbatim); POST/DELETE → 405; the row's aggregates equal the independent J-03 re-run capture EXACTLY and its dataset ids + checksums appear verbatim in the J-02 datasets-list capture; committed `reports/pnl/pnl-history.md` shows identical numbers; MCP `pnl_ledger` byte-identity tested (last tool out of honest-404). Evaluator independently confirmed the `app/mcp/__init__.py` diff is two documentation strings only and the only UPDATE SQL is schema_version bookkeeping. Suite 983 passed / 1 skipped, equivalence 7/7, replay lane 2/2 (J-01, J-08), COHERENCE-PASS.

**Next-step recommendation:** Iter-5 = J-05 (`/performance` page: render `GET /research/pnl/ledger` verbatim — $ beside R beside n, register visible, train/hold-out separate, insufficient-sample labels exercised by the real n=1 founding row; champion summary per blueprint; Performance nav entry rendered from `/meta/ui-routes`, adding `/performance` to the route map — note the stored golden J-01 nav expectations must evolve with the 4th link) at lean depth. J-06 then J-07 after. J-07 planning heads-up: fixture windows arm n=1 per split (< min 5) — see lessons.md.

## Iteration 5 — goal-tape_to_profit-iter-5

**Date:** 2026-07-03T14:12:54+01:00
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: J-05
- Newly failing: none
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none

**Reasoning:** J-05 verified end-to-end: `/performance` reached from the fourth top-bar link (rendered from `/meta/ui-routes`, single owner `app/meta.py`), ledger + champion rendered verbatim (browser-qa's live in-page 24/24 page-equals-API check; screenshot values match the raw ledger JSON capture value-for-value), founding row shows full-precision R/$/n, "insufficient sample (n < 5)" on both splits, the explicit "no prior incumbent" marker, register from the API payload, champion v1/default from the minimally-landed `GET /research/profiles`. Verify-and-complete resume worked as designed: all interrupted-dispatch claims independently reproduced (988 passed / 1 skipped, equivalence 7/7, build clean, replay J-01+J-05 green) with zero code changes. All 5 required-still-passing journeys re-verified (J-01 via the evolved 4-destination golden script, J-08 via replay, J-02/J-03/J-04 via fresh in-page API cycles + suite). MCP diff docstring-only, protected files zero-diff, COHERENCE-PASS. Passing: J-01–J-05, J-08; remaining: J-06, J-07.

**Next-step recommendation:** J-06 at lean depth — register one candidate profile (additive feature key or alternate threshold set), refactor the backtest route's profile refusal to consult the registry, backtest the fixture dataset under default AND the candidate, pin pre-profile equivalence outputs. Caution: `/research/profiles` now returns 200 with a zero-candidate registry (landed minimally at J-05) — that 200 is NOT partial J-06 credit. Required-still-passing browser lane now carries three golden scripts (J-01, J-05, J-08). Then J-07 (sweep), whose promotion-gate tests must control minimum-n both ways (fixture pair arms n=1 per split).
