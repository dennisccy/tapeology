# Goal Session playbook — Lessons Learned

Append-only ledger of takeaways from prior iterations. The goal-evaluator
appends one entry per iteration; the goal-decomposer reads this file before
planning each iteration to avoid repeating known pitfalls.

Each entry should be 1-3 sentences capturing a non-obvious lesson — surprising
failures, regression triggers, or decisions that worked well. Avoid
restating the verdict (the evaluator-log.md already does that).

## iter-0 — 2026-08-10T07:12:37Z

**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Lesson:** The four "route not found" screenshots (`J-01/J-02/J-07/J-08-route-404.png`) are the
same file byte-for-byte (md5 `a11b5066…`): a raw JSON body capture contains no address bar, so it
cannot prove WHICH endpoint was probed — fine for recording an absence, useless once these routes
ship and the acceptance becomes "the endpoint serves the honest empty payload". Capture the URL in
frame (or a body that names its own route) from J-01 onward. Separately: J-10's acceptance text
spans the whole era ("MCP = exactly 20 tools"), so it stays `partial` until J-09 lands — and a
`partial` sentinel does not auto-trip the regression halt, so a kept-screen break must be halted on
manually.
**Applies to:** any iteration capturing browser evidence for a `/research/desk/playbook*` endpoint,
and any iteration reading J-10's status to decide whether the kept product is safe.

## iter-1 — 2026-08-10T11:05:00Z

**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Lesson:** A backend-only iteration silently drops its Required-still-passing replay. The DoD
named TC-14 (replay `journey-scripts/J-10.json`), but the browser lane self-disables on
`Frontend Present: no` ("Browser QA Verdict: SKIPPED"), the dev handoff deferred it to browser-qa,
and the QA report marked it "DEFERRED … N/A" — three lanes each believed another owned it, so
nobody ran it. Any backend-only iteration with a required-still-passing browser journey must ask
for the replay explicitly.
**Applies to:** every iteration whose spec says `Frontend Present: no` while listing a
browser-verifiable journey in Required-still-passing (J-02 next).

## iter-1 — 2026-08-10T11:05:00Z

**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Lesson:** Positional slot indexing fabricates data on gapped sessions, and unit tests cannot see
it. `opening_range`'s 5m fallback took `session_5m[:3]` positionally, so a session missing its
09:30/09:35 bars got an "opening range" built from 09:40/09:45/09:50 and disclosed as genuine —
all 42 tests, the review, and QA passed over it. It surfaced only when the auditor drove
`compute_playbook` end-to-end through a real `BarStore` with a deliberately gapped member. Spec §4's
`halted_formation` policy (the prescribed cure, audit B2) is still entirely unimplemented and must
land before J-07's back-scan touches real recorded sessions.
**Applies to:** any playbook detector/primitive work that indexes bars by position
(`desk_playbook_features.py`, `desk_playbook_detect.py`), and J-07's back-scan.
