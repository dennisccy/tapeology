## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** REL-14 says a journey named in `browser-infra.json` with no fresh screenshot scores
`partial` + `pending_infra`, but forbids `failing` only on infra absence *alone*. All 8 journeys
were named in the token, yet 7 of them have deterministic, evaluator-reproduced proof that their
surfaces do not exist at all (no `docs/hypothesis-foundry/`, no foundry module/route/test, no
desk panel).
**We chose:** score J-02..J-08 `failing` and J-01 `partial` on that independent evidence, and set
`pending_infra` on none of them — a verify-only make-up ride over surfaces that do not exist would
waste an iteration and would push the token to `attempts: 2`, mechanically triggering STALLED for
a blocker that is a one-line in-repo fixture fix. The infra failure is carried as the top active
blocker instead.
**Reversible:** yes
