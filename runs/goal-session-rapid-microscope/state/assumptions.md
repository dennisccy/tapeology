# Goal Session rapid-microscope — Assumption Ledger

Append-only. One entry per scoring decision that required interpreting the goal
rather than only reading evidence. Zero entries in an iteration is normal.

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** J-01 and J-10 each state one combined Acceptance line, but only part of each
was verifiable at era open (J-01's transition documents and era-open baseline; J-10's kept
surfaces, suite, fingerprint and referee hashes). The goal does not say whether partial
satisfaction of a combined acceptance line counts as `failing` or `partial`.
**We chose:** scored both `partial` (browser QA recorded FAIL for the full line), so the
verified sub-checks are not re-done later. `partial` blocks GOAL_ACHIEVED exactly as `failing`
does, so no gate is loosened by this choice.
**Reversible:** yes
