# Goal Session rapid-microscope — Lessons Learned

Append-only ledger of takeaways from prior iterations. The goal-evaluator
appends one entry per iteration; the goal-decomposer reads this file before
planning each iteration to avoid repeating known pitfalls.

Each entry should be 1-3 sentences capturing a non-obvious lesson — surprising
failures, regression triggers, or decisions that worked well. Avoid
restating the verdict (the evaluator-log.md already does that).

## iter-0 — 2026-08-16T23:11:10Z

**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Lesson:** `apps/backend/pyproject.toml` already sets `addopts = "-q"`, so running
`pytest tests/ -q` stacks to verbosity -2 and pytest swallows even the final
"N passed, M skipped" summary line — iteration 0 had to reconstruct 2691/8 by counting
dot-grid characters. Invoke `pytest tests/` (no extra `-q`), or add `-v`, to get the count
directly. Separately: `runs/goal-rapid-microscope-iter-0/status.json` still reads
`browser_checks_run: false` after a completed browser pass (it is written at `dev_complete`
and never refreshed) — trust `reports/phase-*-ui-test-results.md` and the evidence directory,
not that flag.
**Applies to:** every iteration that records the backend suite count for J-10, and any agent
reading status.json to decide whether browser QA ran.
