# Goal Session referee — Evaluator Log

Append-only chronological record. One entry per evaluated iteration.

## Iteration 0 — goal-referee-iter-0

**Date:** 2026-08-14T15:37:59Z
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: none
- Newly failing: J-01, J-02, J-03, J-04, J-05, J-06, J-07, J-08, J-09 (first recorded state — the Referee machinery is unbuilt by design)
- Partial: J-10 (kept-product half verified; the "three Referee sections + 22 MCP tools" clauses of its own acceptance are unmeetable until J-09 lands)
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none

**Reasoning:** This was a verify-only baseline with zero code written, and the checks were
really run instead of assumed. The four Referee web addresses all answer "not found", every
`referee_*.py` file is missing, `authorize_promotion` does not exist, and the Claude connector
still offers 20 tools, not 22 — so nine journeys are honestly recorded as failing. The old
product was walked in a real browser and works: the live tape page shows a converged tape state
with a populated quote and feature panel, the Structure page loads Apple's real price walls
including the 300.11–302.2 band, and the Desk page renders every shipped section with honest
"not computed yet" copy. The full test suite is 2,418 pass / 8 skip, exactly the era-open floor,
and the fingerprint prints `08e471b10130e1e2`. The guard over the owner's saved data reports all
11,274 files unchanged, so nothing was written where it should not be.

**Next-step recommendation:** Iteration 1 should build J-01 "Era transition made testable"
alone, at lean depth: the first backend slice that reports how much evidence the system already
holds (Playbook records, sessions, signals per setup and side; strategy datasets, splits and
trades; the honest statement that the tick-data gate is unmet), plus the two guard tests that
pin the documentation to the code. Every other Referee journey waits on that count.
