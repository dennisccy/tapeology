# Goal Session referee — Assumption Ledger

Append-only. One entry whenever scoring an iteration required interpreting the goal rather than
just reading evidence. The session owner reads this to veto interpretations early.

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** J-10 "The kept product stands" is written as a continuous regression sentinel, but
its own acceptance also names era-end conditions — screenshots of the three Referee `/desk`
sections and "MCP = exactly 22 tools". At iteration 0 the kept-product half is fully verified
while those two clauses are structurally unmeetable (zero sections exist; 20 tools are
advertised). The goal text does not say whether the sentinel should be scored on its
kept-product half alone or on its whole acceptance.
**We chose:** Scored J-10 `partial`, not `passing`/`already_passing` — the whole-acceptance
reading — and recorded the verified kept-product evidence in `journey-history.json` so no later
iteration re-does that work. Consequence: a future break of the kept product would be caught as a
frozen-foundations anti-goal violation rather than by the `passing → failing` regression rule, and
J-10 closes only when J-09 lands.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-1 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** J-01's acceptance requires the strategy family to carry "the `basis_caveats`
forming-bar disclosure verbatim", but no verbatim text for it exists in `docs/goal.md` or
`docs/referee-statistical-spec.md` — only a description of what it must disclose. So there was
nothing to compare the served sentence against.
**We chose:** Accepted this iteration's first authoring as satisfying "verbatim" — the exported
constant `REFEREE_FORMING_BAR_BASIS_CAVEAT` (`apps/backend/app/research/referee_evidence.py`),
whose served text names `levels._bars_as_of`, the `epoch <= as_of` admission, and the Card 6.4
deferral (screenshot `reports/qa/goal-referee-iter-1-evidence/UT-J-01-result.png`). It is now the
single source of truth J-06 and J-08 must import rather than re-word. The owner may want to read
that sentence once and edit it now, while only one caller exists.
**Reversible:** yes
