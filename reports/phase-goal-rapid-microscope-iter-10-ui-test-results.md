| UT-J-07 | Graduation — honest-empty-state on the real ledger (TC-9) | smoke | P1 | `GET /research/desk/micro/graduation` returns HTTP 200 with an explicit empty-state body (`"No candidates ledgered."`) on the real, currently-empty graduation ledger — never a 500, never a fabricated row | Navigated the browser directly to `http://localhost:8301/research/desk/micro/graduation` (backend URL — J-07 has no frontend page this iteration by design); page loaded successfully (no error page); extracted body text is exactly `{"families":[],"message":"No candidates ledgered.","chain_verification":{"ok":true,"failed_at_row":null,"reason":null}}`; matches the dev handoff's own pre-handoff-checklist verification verbatim | PASS | `reports/qa/goal-rapid-microscope-iter-10-evidence/UT-J-07-result.png` |
